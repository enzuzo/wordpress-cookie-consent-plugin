== External services ==

This plugin interfaces with the Enzuzo CMP (Consent Management Platform), which is responsible for managing user consent for cookies and other tracking mechanisms. The plugin integrates with the Enzuzo service to provide cookie consent functionality, such as the cookie banner that prompts users for their consent.

The plugin itself does not send any data directly to external services. The CMP service captures user consent data as part of its compliance with consent management requirements.

This plugin and service is provided by "Enzuzo Inc.": [Terms of Service](https://www.enzuzo.com/terms-of-service), [Privacy Policy](https://www.enzuzo.com/privacy-policy)
